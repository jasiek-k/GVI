  "informative:intro": "Atlas of Modernity is an exhibition that allows to see the collection of Muzeum Sztuki in a different way, but, more importantly, it is also a story of modernity and its meaning from a contemporary perspective constructed with the works included in the collection. It's not a coincidence that modernity becomes the object of reflection in the Muzeum Sztuki. There is no other museum in Poland, whose relationship with modern culture would be equally strong.",
  "informative:zeroParagraph": "The end of modern era and the advent of new times – the times when new paradigms were to be applied – has been announced on numerous occasions. However, the world we live in is still to a large degree defined by phenomena, processes and notions that appeared in modernity. Culture, models of scientific knowledge, social reality, forms of politics, economic mechanisms, our ideas of ourselves and, finally, our desires and fears have all been shaped by modernity. Learning about modernity becomes necessary if we attempt to understand the contemporary world and want to find our place in it.",
  "informative:firstParagraph": "The exhibition at ms2 does not report the history of modernity put in chronological order, neither does it present the history of modern art. It focuses on the most important phenomena that are commonly connected with that which is modern, such as: emancipation, autonomy, industrialisation, capital, urbanisation, experiment, mechanization and revolution. By creating a ‘collage’ of artworks from different periods, representing different aesthetics and artistic attitudes around these notions the exhibition poses questions about how the character of the phenomena changed, how the way they were perceived altered and, most importantly, to what extent they shape contemporary reality.",
  "informative:secondParagraph": "Atlas of Modernity is yet another stage of the works on the Muzeum Sztuki collection that began seven years ago. The aim of the works is researching, re-interpreting and updating the meaning of the art the collection contains. It started in the years 2007-2008 with the preparation of three exhibitions presenting the collection from three different research viewpoints: political, formalist and psychoanalytical. Since 2008 the collection has been exhibited at the newest division of Muzeum Sztuki, ms2, and their consecutive presentations have departed from both the chronological arrangement of works of art and the idea of a ‘permanent exhibition’. As a part of the works on the collection new projects are underway whose aim is to uncover its potential anew – also as it is confronted with other collections (as it was the case with Correspondences. Modern Art and Universalism exhibition).",
  "informative:thirdParagraph": "The collection was made available to the public for the first time in February 1931 at the original seat of the museum in the city hall at 1 Wolności Square. The “a.r.” group collection were gathered in the years 1929–32 and supplemented until 1938. The initiator and the main driving force behind the action of collecting the donations from the artists was Władysław Strzemiński, a painter and art theoretician actively supported by Katarzyna Kobro, a sculptor, Henryk Stażewski, a painter and Jan Brzękowski and Julian Przyboś - poets. The Collection in its ideological dimension reflects Strzemiński’s artistic preferences, although its final shape was the product of the activities of many people including Henryk Stażewski, Hans Arp and Michel Seuphor.",
  "informative:fourthParagraph": "The “a.r” group collection was a review of avant-garde currents and tendencies of the late 1920s and gave rise to the collection of modern art which are still being supplemented with contemporary works from the field of experimenting art. Invariably open to the present it continues its ideological roots which had led to creating the collection. As a part of the new stage the exhibited works of avant-garde artists from the “a.r.” group collection will include art by Max Ernst, Władysław Strzemiński, Katarzyna Kobro, Kurt Schwitters, Kazimierz Podsadecki, Enrico Prampolini, Janusz Maria Brzeski, Teresa Żarnower, Mieczysław Szczuka. The works of (among others) Włodzimierz Borowski, Derek Boshier, Bridget Riley, Christian Boltanski, Joseph Beuys, Ewa Partum, Alina Szapocznikow, Krzysztof Wodiczko, Edward Krasiński, Ali Kazma, Barbara Hammer, Agnieszka Kalinowska, Jadwiga Maziarska, Erna Rosenstein, Jadwiga Sawicka, Ahlam Shibli, Mladen Stilinovic, Mona Vatămanu & Florin Tudor, Haegue Yang, Konrad Smoleński, Cezary Bodzianowski, Liam Gillick, Zbigniew Libera, Zofia Kulik, Julita Wójcik, Artur Żmijewski, Antje Majewski and Allan Sekula, as well as objects and prints from the Museum archives, including a drawing script for the film Jan Matejko by Andrzej Wajda will be placed in the context of issues shaping modernity.",

  "generative:generateLogo": "Generate graphic symbol",
  "generativeText:intro": "The presented visual identity of the Atlas of Modernity exhibition was created with the use of a generative algorithm. This means that the graphic symbol presented, among others, in this section of the website, is the result of the implemented algorithm, and the data on which its operation is based are features describing the exhibits collected at the exhibition in question. Efforts have been made to ensure that the works created by the algorithm remain unique for a single data set. This section will briefly describe aspects such as the way the algorithm works and its features.",
  "generativeText:firstHeader": "HOW THE ALGORITHM WORKS",
  "generativeText:algorithmParagraph": "Before describing the very process of the algorithm's operation, the design grid that was used to create the graphic symbol should be described. The grid consists of 14 squares arranged in 2 rows of 7 each. 1 square corresponds to 1 area of ​​modernity accepted at the Atlas of Modernity exhibition. There are 4 horizontal roads, 17 vertical roads and 4 diagonal roads on them.",
  "generativeText:stepsIntro": "As for the algorithm's operation process, it can be divided into three parts:",
  "generativeText:algorithmFirstStep": "1. Generation of horizontal and vertical roads",
  "generativeText:algorithmSecondStep": "2. Generation of diagonal roads",
  "generativeText:algorithmThirdStep": "3. Separation of the final graphic symbol.",
  "generativeText:roadsFeatures": "In the case of horizontal and vertical roads, the parameters describing them and the rules for calculating them are the same, hence they were included in the common step. The parameters mentioned are as follows:",
  "generativeText:firstRoadFeature": "- starting point",
  "generativeText:secondRoadFeature": "- maximum length",
  "generativeText:thirdRoadFeature": "- index describing the position of the road on the grid",
  "generativeText:obliqueRoadFeature": "However, in the case of oblique roads, only the index corresponding to the road arrangement on the grid is drawn.",
  "generativeText:algorithmWork": "The algorithm starts by selecting one work, the data of which will be used to generate the graphic symbol. Its parameters are appropriately converted in the mentioned first two steps. After obtaining a grid with all paths drawn, a single square is drawn, which after separation becomes the new exhibition logo.",
  "generativeText:algorithmFeatures": "FEATURES OF THE ALGORITHM",
  "generativeText:firstFeatureHeader": "Putting the features of the exhibition into the operation of the algorithm",
  "generativeText:secondFeatureHeader": "Linking the created symbol with the exhibits of the exhibition",
  "generativeText:thirdFeatureHeader": "Ensuring uniqueness",
  "generativeText:firstFeatureText1": "The created graphic system should in a specific way reflect the features characteristic of the exhibition it describes. In this case, these features became: fragmentary and discontinuous, and their selection was dictated by the manner in which the exhibition was described in one of the Museum's guides:",
  "generativeText:firstFeatureText2": "The term 'map' also becomes a key issue, as a definition of a single area of ​​modern art from among the many presented at the exhibition. The aforementioned properties of the exhibition are included in the conceptual layer of the created algorithm, so that each symbol resulting from its operation finds its connection with the exhibition object.",
  "generativeText:firstFeatureQuote": "The 'atlas' appearing in the title best describes the structure of the exhibition: it is a specific set of 'maps', each of which describes the topography of a different territory of modernity. [...] Maps certainly do not cover all areas of the modern world, but neither were their ambitions. After all, the incompleteness of this collection, as well as the collage manner of its organization, seem to best reflect the modern way of seeing reality with its fragmentation and discontinuity.",
  "generativeText:secondFeatureText": "Additionally, it was searched for how the exhibits collected at the exhibition, the presence of which and the way they are selected, shape its character, can influence the attributes of the generated sign. We managed to create this kind of association by using the works presented at the exhibition in the process of creating the sign. This is done so that the parameters of the created symbols are calculated in a systematic way.",
  "generativeText:thirdFeatureText": "Since each symbol is based on data from one of the works of the Atlas of Modernity and is to represent them in the language of visual means, it should also provide them with individuality and uniqueness to differentiate the works from one another. Therefore, efforts should be made to introduce mechanisms that prevent the creation of an identical graphic symbol for two or more completely different works. The adopted solution to this problem is based on the appropriate selection of the design grid and the thickness of the drawn lines in such a way that they differ for graphic symbols based on those parts of the grid that repeat.",
